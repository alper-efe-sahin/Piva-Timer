### What you can do with Piva Timer?
Let's think about whether you are a student or a worker, it does not matter. It's common that almost every person when they work, set time to evaluate their work time. Piva supplies this to you via Flutter. You just have to set a time, and that's it. When the time is up, it will send notifications to you, even foreground and background (locked phone, switching apps, etc.).

Also If you need multiple languages, you can easily implement them, via the localization folder (right now the app has 2 languages, Turkish, and English).

Simple, but useful.
